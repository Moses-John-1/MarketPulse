# MarketPulse

**Goal of this project:**  
MarketPulse is a simple stock watchlist application that allows users to quickly look up basic information about publicly traded companies without using complex or overwhelming platforms. Many existing stock tools provide too much data for beginners or casual users, making it difficult to get a clear snapshot of a company at a glance.

This application solves that problem by presenting only essential stock and company information in a clean and easy-to-understand format.

**Motivation:**  
The motivation for this project comes from my interest in capital markets and investing, and my desire to create a practical tool that helps users access stock information efficiently while strengthening my skills in working with APIs, JavaScript, and dynamic web interfaces.
